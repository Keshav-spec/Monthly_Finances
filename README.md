- It was observed that the individual experienced a steady increase in income, rising from 392K in 2018 to 465K in 2019, and reaching 593K in 2020. However, alongside this income growth, the expense percentage also increased, climbing from 73% in 2018 to 77% in 2019, and 78% in 2020. Consequently, the savings percentage declined significantly from 27% in 2018 to just 17% by 2020, indicating a shift towards higher spending despite increased earnings.
